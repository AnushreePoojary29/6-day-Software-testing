On Day 5, we built a GitHub repository for our portfolio and deployed it using Render.
Key points covered:

Created a new GitHub repository specifically for our personal portfolio website.

Pushed the complete portfolio project (HTML/CSS/JavaScript or React files) to the GitHub repository.

Set up the project structure properly for deployment (e.g., having an index.html or proper build folder if using React).

Learned how to connect the GitHub repository to Render.

Deployed the portfolio live using Render's static site hosting feature.

Understood the importance of build commands (like npm run build for React apps) during deployment.

Explored how to update the deployed site automatically by pushing changes to the GitHub repository.

Learned to copy and share the Render live site URL to showcase our portfolio to others.

This session helped us understand the end-to-end flow of publishing a personal website from development, version control using GitHub, to deployment on a live server using Render.
