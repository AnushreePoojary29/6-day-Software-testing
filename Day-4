Creation of a Virtual Environment: We established a virtual environment to ensure our project dependencies are managed separately from the global Python installation, preventing potential conflicts. ​

Development of a Personal Portfolio: Utilizing the virtual environment, we constructed a personal portfolio project, allowing us to apply our skills in a controlled setting.​

Enhanced Understanding of Dependency Management: This process deepened our comprehension of how to handle project-specific packages and dependencies effectively.​

Improved Project Organization: We learned the importance of isolating project environments, which aids in maintaining a clean and organized development workspace. ​
