On Day 6, we learned the basics of Selenium and worked with it using a virtual environment.

Key highlights from the session:

Understood what Selenium is â€” a powerful tool for automating web browsers.

Installed Selenium using pip inside a virtual environment to manage dependencies cleanly.
Learned about WebDrivers (e.g., ChromeDriver) and how they interact with browsers.

Wrote simple Python scripts using Selenium to:

Launch a browser window.

Open a website (like Google or any other).

Locate elements using methods like find_element_by_name, find_element_by_id, etc.

Perform actions such as clicking buttons or typing into input fields.

Understood basic concepts like locators, automation flow, and browser control.

This session gave us a strong introduction to web automation and taught us how to set up a clean Python environment for working on such projects.
