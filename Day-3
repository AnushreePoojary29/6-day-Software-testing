On Day 3, we learned about creating a virtual environment in software development. A virtual environment is an isolated space where we can install specific packages and dependencies required for a particular project without affecting other projects or the system-wide settings. We explored the need for a virtual environment, which helps in avoiding conflicts between different versions of packages and maintaining a clean and organized development workspace. Using a virtual environment is especially useful when working on multiple projects that require different libraries or versions of the same library. It also improves project portability and makes collaboration easier, as others can replicate the same environment using requirement files like requirements.txt.
